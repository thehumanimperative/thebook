I try not to use the word 'need' too often. When I do, I prefer to mean it. I need to write a book, soon. Why? I have a plan to break down the intelligence barrier.

This is important to me because I am dissatisfied with the traditional college education. Just go to school. There you will quickly discover that our way of doing things is prohibitively difficult. There (and here) intelligence becomes an asset. But I believe this is a false idol. From my perspective, creativity in art is our primary interest. We are a thriving species, despite our glaring flaws. For us, we orchestrate massive creative projects, resulting in our modern state of the art.

On a personal level, I have come to hate how intolerant we are as a species. I am infested with the stuff, and most every person I have met is right here with me. We are sick of intolerance; I can hear it in our voices. We try to hate it away, fail. We try to fight it off, fail. We try to deny its existence, fail. Now I just turn my intolerance inward on itself. I am intolerant of intolerance.

If you have ever studied engineering, you have heard of a thing called tolerance. Tolerance in this context always implies flexibility. You have a tolerance in your measurement, like 'how much wiggle room do I have for error?' On the flipside however, intolerance suggests inflexibiliy. Incapable of being flexed. Rigid.

By observation, I think it's clear that as living organisms, rigid is a bad way to exist.

So I figure, the better I get at being intolerant of intolerance within myself, the more flexible I become and better fit I become to pursue my goals. Eventually, intolerance will become a tool that I wield, not a compulsion.

This of course is a type of faith, and I commit to it.
